# Signals Implementation

This is the repository used for my own implementation for signals, used in teaching and learning purposes.

It has a suite for testing the signals and the implementation of the signals.

## Technologies Used

| Type            | Technology                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Language        | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ðŸ¦• |
| Runtime         | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) ðŸ“¦             |
| Package Manager | [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) ðŸ“¦                       |

## Installing the pnpm and packages

This repo uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) package manager, so you need to install it first.

Use the following command to install it globally:

<small>If you have `npm`</small>

```console
npm install -g pnpm
```

<small>If you have `yarn`</small>

```console
yarn global add pnpm
```

---

Then you can install the packages with:

```console
pnpm install
```

With that you will have all the packages installed in the root of the repo and all the projects inside this repo.
